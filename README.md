# Extensions.NET
Do you ever find yourself writing the same extension methods with every single project?
Well, I do, and I have a set of such methods that I use over and over again and I consider part of my C# "arsenal". 
They encompass the following areas:

1. Primitive Types:
* object
* string / StringBuilder
* byte / arrays
* exceptions
* enums

2. Collections:
* IEnummerable extensions
* IList extensions
* IDictionary extesnsions
* Lambda Comparer

3. ADO Extensions for EF/EF Core:
* Connection extensions
* Command extensions
* Data Reader extensions

The libraries are light-weight and do not introduce extra clutter.
